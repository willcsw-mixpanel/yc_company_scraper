Our conviction is that 3D embodiment, shared activities in games and AI imbued with human-like personalities will solve the existing problems of low-stakes, shallow and generic interactions that impact retention in consumer AI chat experiences.  \r\n\r\nWe’re fine-tuning a foundation model for characters to behave in human-like ways—indistinguishable from real people—and building a UGC platform around it to allow users to create, experience and form meaningful connections & mutual stories with these AI characters. On our platform, simworld, users will be able place the characters in a Stardew Valley style simulated town, where the AI characters will live, work and play, leading rich internal lives. Users who deepen bonds with these AI character friends can invite them out with them to Discord, Minecraft or even a Netflix-n-chill session.\r\n\r\nOur Character engine, ego AI, built on top of Unreal, will allow users to create, deploy and even monetize their characters across any surface that supports our CCProtocol. The first use case for our characters will likely be DnD-style roleplay, Minecraft RP, and Twitch streaming. \r\n\r\nCharacters will always live and exist in Simtowns with other AIs (and humans) where they will all lead varied internal lives replete with conflict, danger, opportunity, and love…just like humans in the real world!\r\n\r\nDuring YC, we used our engine to build TownWorld - a 3D interactive Twitch live stream of the Stanford generative agents paper (https://www.twitch.tv/townworld).
