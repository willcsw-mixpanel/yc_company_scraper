Legacy optical satellites are rendered useless 70% of the time by weather and night cycles, while Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) produces data that is unintelligible to humans and breaks standard vision pipelines.\r\n\r\nWe solve this by translating raw radar backscatter into analysis-ready optical imagery in real-time. Our proprietary architecture uses deterministic one-step diffusion to transform complex radar signals into clear, photorealistic images. This enables persistent, 24/7 situational awareness for defense, commodities trading, and disaster response, guaranteeing visibility even when the sky is blocked.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"one_liner":{"value":"Foundation models for 24/7 Earth Observation","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"tags":[{"value":"Deep Learning","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Satellites","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Weather","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"id":31207,"name":"Caretta","slug":"caretta","former_names":[],"small_logo_thumb_url":"https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/small_logos/9b2cec49b6c47c5edddfb78c96e58a79924a1032.png","website":"https://www.caretta.so","all_locations":"San Francisco, CA, USA","long_description":"Caretta is a Sales Intelligence for revenue teams.
